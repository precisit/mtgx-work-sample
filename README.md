# MTGx Work Sample

Work sample for Fullstack Developer, MTGx. Built on a boilerplate based on gulp/browserify/angular/bootstrap-sass.

	npm install

	gulp dev

Start the local server for proxying traileraddict requests (CORS) by running: 

	node backend/server.js

### Testing

	gulp test

## Tools

Familiar tools were used to ease the development process, these are listed below

- Node.js & npm
- Gulp
- Browserify
- AngularJS
- Bootstrap-sass
- Express, cors, node-rest-client
- Karma

## Left out

Some things were left out due to time constraints, such as

- Links in general 
- User management
- Other sections (Series, Barn, etc)
- Much of the styling
- Error handling
- Unit testing
- Auto playback of the trailer (could investigate JWplayer)

Boilerplate and filestructure is a good foundation to continue project.
